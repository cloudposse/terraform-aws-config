dynamodb-autoscaling-enabled:
  identifier: DYNAMODB_AUTOSCALING_ENABLED
  description: >-
    Checks whether Auto Scaling or On-Demand is enabled on your DynamoDB tables and/or global secondary indexes.
    Optionally you can set the read and write capacity units for the table or global secondary index.
  inputParameters:
    # The following parameters are optional:
    #
    # minProvisionedReadCapacity:   The minimum number of units that should be provisioned with read capacity in the
    #                               Auto Scaling group.
    # minProvisionedWriteCapacity:  The minimum number of units that should be provisioned with write capacity in the
    #                               Auto Scaling group.
    # maxProvisionedReadCapacity:   The maximum number of units that should be provisioned with read capacity in the
    #                               Auto Scaling group.
    # maxProvisionedWriteCapacity:  The maximum number of units that should be provisioned with write capacity in the
    #                               Auto Scaling group.
    # targetReadUtilization:        The target utilization percentage for read capacity. Target utilization is expressed
    #                               in terms of the ratio of consumed capacity to provisioned capacity.
    # targetWriteUtilization:       The target utilization percentage for write capacity. Target utilization is
    #                               expressed in terms of the ratio of consumed capacity to provisioned capacity.

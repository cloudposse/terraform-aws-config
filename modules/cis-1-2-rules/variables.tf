variable "support_policy_arn" {
  description = <<-DOC
    The ARN of the IAM Policy required for compliance with 1.20 of the Benchmark, which states:

    Ensure a support role has been created to manage incidents with AWS Support

    AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support
    and customer services.

    Create an IAM role to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support. By implementing least privilege
    for access control, an IAM role will require an appropriate IAM policy to allow support center access in order to
    manage incidents with AWS Support.

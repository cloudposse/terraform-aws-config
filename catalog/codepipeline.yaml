codepipeline-deployment-count-check:
  identifier: CODEPIPELINE_DEPLOYMENT_COUNT_CHECK
  description: >-
    Checks whether the first deployment stage of the AWS CodePipeline performs more than one deployment. Optionally,
    checks if each of the subsequent remaining stages deploy to more than the specified number of deployments
    (deploymentLimit). The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if the first stage in the AWS CodePipeline deploys to more than one
    region and the AWS CodePipeline deploys to more than the number specified in the deploymentLimit.
  inputParameters:
    # The following parameters are required:
    #
    # deploymentLimit: The maximum number of deployments each stage can perform.

codepipeline-region-fanout-check:
  identifier: CODEPIPELINE_REGION_FANOUT_CHECK
  description: >-
    ? Checks whether each stage in the AWS CodePipeline deploys to more than N times the number of the regions the AWS
      CodePipeline has deployed in all the previous combined stages, where N is the region fanout number. The first
      deployment stage can deploy to a maximum of one region and the second deployment stage can deploy to a maximum
      number specified in the regionFanoutFactor. If you do not provide a regionFanoutFactor, by default the value is
      three. For example
    : If 1st deployment stage deploys to one region and 2nd deployment stage deploys to three regions, 3rd deployment
      stage can deploy to 12 regions, that is, sum of previous stages multiplied by the region fanout (three) number.
      The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if the deployment is in more than one region in 1st stage or three regions in 2nd stage
      or 12 regions in 3rd stage.
  inputParameters:
    # The following parameters are required:
    #
    # regionFanoutFactor: The number of regions the AWS CodePipeline has deployed to in all previous stages is the
    #                     acceptable number of regions any stage can deploy to.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

```hcl
module "example" {
  source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-config.git?ref=master"

  create_sns_topic = true
  create_iam_role  = true

  managed_rules = {
    account-part-of-organizations = {
      description  = "Checks whether AWS account is part of AWS Organizations. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if an AWS account is not part of AWS Organizations or AWS Organizations master account ID does not match rule parameter MasterAccountId.",
      identifier   = "ACCOUNT_PART_OF_ORGANIZATIONS",
      trigger_type = "PERIODIC"
      enabled      = true
    }
  }
}
```
